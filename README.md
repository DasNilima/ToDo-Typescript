## Chanllenges faced

There were a few challenges that came up during the development of the application. Firstly, working with  CRUDs with  POSTMAN, I had some difficulty posting an updated state object to a database, then implementing all the code of components and importing to the app.js, also got some issues when tried to rendering the page locally. Lastly, also having some difficulty while tried to remote hosting of a project via heroku deployment. However, all these challenges helpful to clarify the concept  and how to deal with every situation through troubleshooting appraoch.
